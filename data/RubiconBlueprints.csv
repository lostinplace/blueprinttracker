In the Gallente Federation, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Navitas.

The Navitas had been a solid mining vessel that had seen wide use by independent excavators, along with being one of the best ships available for budding traders and even for much-maligned scavengers. After its redesign, its long-range scanners and sturdy outer shell gave way entirely for remote repairing capabilities, moving the Navitas away from the calming buzz of mining lasers and into the roar of battle.",120000,120000,120000,90000
Tristan,940,593,"<font size=""14""><b>Development</b></font>
Often nicknamed The Fat Man this nimble little frigate is mainly used by the Federation in escort duties or on short-range patrols. The Tristan has been very popular throughout Gallente space for years because of its versatility.

Incursus,941,594,"<font size=""14""><b>Development</b></font>
The Incursus may be found both spearheading and bulwarking Gallente military operations. Its speed makes it excellent for skirmishing duties, while its resilience helps it outlast its opponents on the battlefield. Incursus-class ships move together in groups and can quickly and effectively gang up on ships many times their size and overwhelm them. In recent years the Incursus has increasingly found its way into the hands of pirates, who love its aggressive appearance. ",120000,120000,120000,90000

In the Minmatar Republic, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Burst.

The Burst had been a small and fast cargo vessel. This all changed after the redesign, when the Burst found its small-time mining capabilities curtailed in lieu of logistics systems that moved its focus to shield support for friendly vessels.",120000,120000,120000,90000

The Kestrel was designed so that it could take up to four missile launchers but as a result it can not be equipped with turret weapons nor with mining lasers.",120000,120000,120000,90000
Merlin,950,603,"<font size=""14""><b>Development</b></font>
The Merlin is the most powerful combat frigate of the Caldari. Its role has evolved through the years, and while its defenses have always remained exceptionally strong for a Caldari vessel, its offensive capabilities have evolved from versatile, jack-of-all-trades attack patterns into focused and deadly gunfire tactics. The Merlin's primary aim is to have its turrets punch holes in opponents' hulls.",120000,120000,120000,90000

Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Caldari State the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Osprey.

The Osprey originally offered excellent versatility and power for what was considered a comparably low price. After its redesign, its inbuilt mining technology - now a little creaky and long in the tooth - was gutted from the Osprey and replaced in its entirety with tech of a different type, capable of high energy and shield transfers.",240000,240000,240000,180000

Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Amarr Empire the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Augoror.

The Augoror-class cruiser is one of the old warhorses of the Amarr Empire, having seen action in both the Jovian War and the Minmatar Rebellion. Like most Amarr vessels, the Augoror depended first and foremost on its resilience and heavy armor to escape unscathed from unfriendly encounters. After its overhaul, it had some of the armor stripped off to make room for equipment allowing it to focus on the armor of other vessels, along with energy transfers.",240000,240000,240000,180000

Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Minmatar Republic  the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Scythe.

The Scythe-class cruiser remains the oldest Minmatar ship still in use. It has seen many battles and is an integrated part in Minmatar tales and heritage. With its redesign, past firmware upgrades for mining output were tossed out entirely in favor of two new separate systems that focused on shield transporting and logistics drones respectively.",240000,240000,240000,180000

Both Frigate and Cruiser-class ships were put under the microscope, and in the Gallente Federation the outcome of the re-evaluation process led, among other developments, to a redesign and redeployment of the Exequoror.

The Exequror was a heavy cargo cruiser originally strong enough to defend itself against raiding frigates, though it lacked prowess in heavier combat situations. After its redesign, it had some of that bulk - and, necessarily, some of that strength - yanked out and replaced with the capability to help others in heavy combat situations, in particular those who needed armor repairs.",240000,240000,240000,180000

Scorpion Ishukone Watch,4006,4005,"With its focus on electronic warfare, few ships can resist the direct onslaught of the Ishukone Watch Scorpion-class battleship's jamming capabilities.
 
<font color=white><u>Details</u></font>
This variant of the Scorpion represents the pinnacle of the Ishukone paramilitary force's electronic warfare capabilities.
 
<font color=white><u>Development</u></font>
When Ishukone Watch was commissioned to produce a run of Scorpion-class battleships for its parent company, it was decided that a number of extra units would be offered to the capsuleer community to help fund the effort. Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet's production.

The first of these vessels was awarded to Gallente pilot Jack DuVal on June 4th YC115 as a gesture of good will, after it was stolen from an Ishukone Watch shipyard in orbit of Caldari Prime by the Guristas Pirates, before being abandoned in his hangar in Korama after a lengthy pursuit across the Caldari Border Zone.
 
<font color=white><u>Technology</u></font>
Though the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special LADAR and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.

<font color=white><u>Notes</u></font>
Many wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an ""incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority.""",360000,360000,360000,270000

While there are persistent rumors of storage crew personnel tasting the cargo and subsequently staying awake for days on end, grinding their teeth and yelling at each other, these have never been conclusively proven, although the Quafe Corporation does reportedly undertake all medical costs for any crewmember serving more than 72 consecutive hours onboard the Miasmos Quafe Ultramarine Edition.

Named after a mythical beast renowned for its voraciousness, the Wolf is one of the most potentially destructive frigates currently in existence.  While hardier than its brother the Jaguar it has less in the way of shield systems, and the capabilities of its onboard computer leave something to be desired.  Nevertheless, the mere sight of a locked and loaded Wolf should be enough to make most pilots turn tail and flee.

The Retribution is an homage to the glory days of the Empire, informed by classical Amarrian design philosophy: if it's strong, sturdy and packs a punch, it's ready for action.  What this powerhouse lacks in speed and maneuverability it more than makes up for with its wide range of firepower possibilities and superb defensive ability.

Gas Cloud Harvester I,25267,25266,"The core technology employed by Gas Harvesters dates back centuries, to a time when the extraction of material in space was still a growing industry. Originally, asteroid miners had seen the tractor beams and in-space catalytic conversions used by today's Gas Harvesters as a promising new method for extracting spacebound ore. After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology, which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession to this day.

When the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from. Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed, there was a need for much greater efficiency. It was not until the mining industry returned to long-abandoned projects that a solution was found. Since that time, Gas harvesting technology has slowly moved forward, giving birth to new industries and economies in the process.

This results in a great increase in the carrier's ability to provide aid to members of its fleet, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance. Due to the ionic flux created by the triage module, remote effects like warp scrambling et al. will not affect the ship while in triage mode.

This also means that friendly remote effects will not work while in triage mode either. The flux only disrupts incoming effects, however, meaning the carrier can still provide aid to its cohorts. Sensor strength and targeting capabilities are also significantly boosted. In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship, nor is the carrier able to dock until out of triage mode. Finally, any drones or fighters currently in space will be abandoned when the module is activated.

Note: A triage module requires Strontium Clathrates to run and operate effectively. Only one triage module can be run at any given time, so fitting more than one has no practical use. The remote repair module bonuses are only applied to capital sized modules. The amount of shield boosting gained from the Triage Module is subject to a stacking penalty when used with other similar modules that affect the same attribute on the ship.

This module can only be fit on Carriers.",540000,360000,900000,9000

Rorqual,28353,28352,"The Rorqual was conceived and designed by Outer Ring Excavations in response to a growing need for capital industry platforms with the ability to support and sustain large-scale mining operations in uninhabited areas of space.

To that end, the Rorqual's primary strength lies in its ability to grind raw ores into particles of smaller size than possible before, while still maintaining their distinctive molecular structure. This means the vessel is able to carry vast amounts of ore in compressed form.

Additionally, the Rorqual is able to fit a capital tractor beam unit, capable of pulling in cargo containers from far greater distances and at far greater speeds than smaller beams can.

Krusual elders whisper ancient tales among their huddled tribes, describing the glory of heroes past and enigmatic prophecies of old. On the darkest day, at the most hopeless moments, an elder may speak of <i>loki</i>, in reverent tones and excited hushes. In the ancient tongue, the <i>loki</i> are the crux of Krusual thought. There is no direct translation for this word; in fact, <i>loki</i> translates differently among the elders. It can mean “hidden wonder” or “secret passage”, “changing mask” or “unseen dagger”. Regardless of its context, <i>loki</i> has one meaning common to all its tales across all the elders: “hope”.

Optimized Nano-engines,29993,29992,"Forming the beating heart of the Sleeper's automated drones, these tiny engines count in the billions. When fully intact, they deliver levels of power efficiency unrivalled by current technology. Unfortunately, whenever a Sleeper drone is destroyed, these engines are the first to go with them, making it difficult to emulate their functionality without the addition of other materials. 

To recreate a functional nanoengine housing, PPD fullerene fibers are combined with metallofullerenes and fullerene fiber conduits to rebuild the basic structures that once housed them. After that, the fused nanomechanical engines are connected to one another, forming a composite whole. 

Although mechanical engineers have theorized about this construction method for many decades, the process was always held back by a lack of fullerene material. It is said that only hours after the discovery of fullerite clouds in wormhole space, the empires used significant amounts of their fullerene stockpiles to produce these engines. The reasoning behind this is simply the staggering breadth of potential applications these engines have. When it comes to engineering, there isn't much they can't do.",20000,10000,1500000,1000000
Warfare Computation Core,29995,29994,"Warfare computation cores begin as basic microprocessors that handle the flow of data between various combat analyzers, prioritizing vital information and calculations. The cores are first built around salvaged Sleeper warfare processors which are then further enhanced by the integration of fullerene polymers and other Sleeper technology. The addition of emergent combat analyzers expands the functionality to include more abstract combat calculations, such as comparative analyses of fleets and predictive IFF identifications. 

When encased in thermophased metallofullerene plating, the cores can be embedded directly into the ship's hull. This allows for a far more efficient production method of Tech III vessels, enabling any subsystem variation to integrate into a hull without the need for further redesign in the combat electronics systems.

Emergent Neurovisual Interface,29997,29996,"As a capsuleer, few things are more important in space flight than the ability to instantly gauge one's surroundings and make decisions accordingly. For this reason, capsules inside starships make frequent use of neurovisual reproductions; emulations that recreate external stimuli using the most low-latency processor available – the human brain. This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After capturing the data, they then feed it directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously. Functions familiar to any capsuleer such as the overview, tactical overlay and hostile threat indicators are just a few examples of the device's capabilities. 

Although NVI technology has been around since the inception of the capsule, the addition of salvaged Sleeper drone components and the now widely available fullerene polymers has carried the functionality forward into the new Tech III paradigm. Even before the first Strategic Cruiser was built, engineers hypothesized about potential issues with an NVI trying to communicate with an almost limitless combination of subsystems. Fortunately, the solution to the problem came wrapped up in the same technology that moved Tech III vessels from the world of scientific theory into reality.",20000,10000,1500000,1000000
Fullerene Intercalated Sheets,30003,30002,"The manufacture of this component requires the rarest and most valuable technology salvageable from Sleeper drones. These sheets represent some of the most advanced composite materials known to New Eden. When other, more valuable devices are embedded into the structure at the molecular level, the sheets' performance enhances tremendously. The end result is a component with an almost endless number of applications in starship design. 

Ultra-resilient armor plating, defensive nanoassemblers, electronics housing, and even the molecular-level circuitry itself are only a few of the near-countless roles that fullerene intercalated sheets can perform. Although unrivalled in their modularity, the cost of construction remains a barrier on supply; consequently, they remain a component to be used only when absolutely necessary. 

Scientists and engineers alike claim that a steadier supply of these rare Sleeper pieces would instantly advance starship design ten years.

Although they have many uses in the manufacture of armor plating, the distinguishing feature of the alloys is the level of modularity they allow in starship design.

Loki Propulsion - Fuel Catalyst,30111,30110,"The ancient Sleeper race was known to have mastered various sustainable energy technologies including thermoelectric systems, which they usually built directly into a vessel's hull. Capsuleer reverse-engineers took little time to adapt salvaged versions of these Sleeper energy systems into their own modular Tech III vessel pieces. 

Thanks to widespread demand in many Minmatar industries, fuel catalyst systems were one of the first to be developed. Making full use of locally generated thermoelectric power, they are able to partially meet the fuel needs of an afterburner. This process makes it possible to inject fuel in larger amounts for the same capacitor cost, offering pilots a significant boost to the velocity increase from afterburners.

The origins of the first “nullifier” designs are shrouded in mystery, but the subsystem's initial production of is thought to have taken place soon after the wormhole openings, and well before the technology became widespread knowledge. Not long after the first Tengu were designed, the Caldari Navy intercepted emergency transmissions from Guristas fleets across Venal, Tenal and Vale of the Silent. All of the reports made mention of Loki-class vessels slipping past defensive deployments and into core Guristas territory despite all efforts to stop the ships or slow them down.  

Following these reports, rumors spread that other groups began to discover and implement this extraordinary new technology, and yet of all the factions that leapt upon the opportunity, none were so eager or ruthless in their own race to capitalize as the independent capsuleer and pirate organizations that make the nullsec frontiers their home.

The Amarrians are suspected to have developed cloaking technology for the Legion around the same time as the first capsuleer designs began to surface. For almost a full week, Minmatar rebel camps deep inside Heimatar and Metropolis were subjected to ruthless guerilla attacks, almost unprecedented in their ferocity and viciousness.  Although initially confused by such a marked changed in their opponent's warfare philosophy, the Matari knew that each target had been a high profile objective for the Amarr Navy, and noted with deep suspicion how all of the squads had been spearheaded by Legions that could hit and fade with alarming ease. Few doubted who was behind the bloodshed. The Amarrians remained silent for the most part, the only official statement; that God's will had manifested itself in the heart of evil.

To many Gallente and Caldari, the development of the Proteus covert reconfiguration signaled a repeat of the technological arms race that arose from the ashes of Crielere. Once again seeking a balance of power, and entirely convinced that the Caldari were attempting to reverse-engineer their own cloak-capable Strategic Cruisers, the Federation diverted immense resources to their research. Private firms and the largest of conglomerates all played a role in development, offering up prototype designs and speculative theories that collectively resulted in some of the first Covert-Capable Proteus produced. It is not known who, or what organization led the project. Nor is known when, or where, the first Covert Reconfigurations were deployed.

The Loki's Covert Reconfiguration designs arose out of a collective will to respond to what was thought to be Amarrian aggression deep inside their home regions.

It was only through consultation and collaboration with many other tribes and sub-factions that something substantial began to take shape. 

The Krusual and Thukker are said to have played the most important roles, however, in realizing the final design; the Thukker by providing the cloaking technology, and the Krusual by convincing them to do so.

Metallofullerene Plating,30465,30464,"Metallofullerene plating is used to protect the connective joins in hull and subsystem structures so that Tech III vessels can be taken apart and put back together endlessly, all without the risk of wear. Mechanical engineers first attempted to create the plating using plutonium metallofullerenes, but it was quickly discovered that even miniscule amounts of them had a sizeable impact on ship mass. When integrated into armor plating in larger amounts, they also risked turning the vessel into a giant warhead, something even less desirable. 

A solution was finally found. Tiny amounts of metallofullerenes would be integrated in conjunction with far larger quantities of graphene nanoribbons and then coated in powdered C-540 graphite. This process allowed the material to maintain structural durability whilst keeping mass down. The last and most ingenious addition was to incorporate fulleroferrocene into the metal beneath layers of electromechanical hull sheeting. This had the effect of turning the normally dangerous explosive reactions into kinetic energy, which could then be used to supplement the power supply to local nanoassemblers.",20000,10000,1500000,1000000
Electromechanical Interface Nexus,30467,30466,"When integrated into a starship with other components, an EMI Nexus is used to facilitate manual control over numerous electromechanical systems which, by default, run in an automated manner according to their programmed roles. Typically, the EMI Nexus acts as a conduit between a capsuleer and their ship, serving as an interface through which they can operate normally automated electromechanical systems, such as a Central System Controller. Other more simple tasks, such as the activation of a ship's modules, also frequently rely on these components.",20000,10000,1500000,1000000
Neurovisual Output Analyzer,30471,30470,"As a capsuleer, few things are more important in space-flight than the ability to instantly gauge one's surroundings and make decisions accordingly. For this reason, capsules inside starships make frequent use of neurovisual reproductions; emulations that recreate external stimuli using the most low-latency processor available: the human brain. This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After the data is captured, it is then relayed directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously.

The synthetic translation of external stimuli into neurovisual imagery is incredibly risky, even relative to the standard hazards of pod piloting. Even though capsuleers have an innate resistance to neurobiological damage from these sorts of processes, the near- constant exposure to them has been linked to increased risk of aggressive neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, engineers have begun to integrate neurovisual output analyzers into a starship's electronics systems. These devices monitor the pilot's status and, if necessary, take measures to protect against anything from mild headaches to catastrophic neural failure.",20000,10000,1500000,1000000
Nanowire Composites,30475,30474,"Nanowire composites function as connective links between subsystems. Graphene nanoribbons form the base of the components, carrying electrical power between other devices integrated into electromechanical hull sheets. A final coating of thermal diffusion film ensures efficient heat dispersion, allowing a starship captain to overload modules connected to subsystems without risking the entire vessel.",20000,10000,1500000,1000000
Fulleroferrocene Power Conduits,30477,30476,"These conduits supply power to minute, molecular-level devices. Extremely strong and yet surprising flexible, they have traditionally been used in rare situations where the normal methods of power supply were rendered impossible. The advent of Tech III starship technology and the influx of fullerene-based materials have seen the conduits take on new and more widespread roles. 

The addition or removal of a single subsystem in a Tech III vessel can drastically change the ship's structure, and with it the internal wiring and available power supply routes.  Fulleroferrocene power conduits have become an essential component in the construction of these new vessels for this very reason. The conduits can be remapped through a ship with relative ease, allowing for the near-endless variations of subsystems to be completely interchangeable without posing any problems of how to power them.",20000,10000,1500000,1000000
Reconfigured Subspace Calibrator,30479,30478,"Subspace calibrators perform the crucial role of tuning in on subspace frequencies. Being able to accurately pinpoint a destination on the other side of a wormhole is vital to interstellar travel, as it allows pilots to traverse wormholes safe in the knowledge that they won't accidentally arrive out the other side at the centre of a sun. 

This particular calibrator was produced from a combination of fullerene polymers and salvaged Sleeper technology. The unique grouping enables some drastic reconfigurations to the basic design. The end result is a vastly increased efficiency in calculation time. Due to the modular design of Tech III vessels, tuning into subspace frequencies must be done individually for each subsystem. The development of this particular component has been an important time-saver in an area where mere seconds can mean life or death.",20000,10000,1500000,1000000

The resulting vessel maintained the shield defenses known among similar ships of its type, while adding an array of remarkable black ops capabilities.

Aliastra purchased a large fleet of Catalysts several years ago, to protect its inter-Empire shipping routes. Subsequent evaluations determined that the Catalyst was considerably over-gunned for many of its safer routes, so 30% of their hulls were sold off and replaced by cheaper frigates.

As such, the Dragoon focuses on sending out a mass of drones, ones capable not only of swiftly hunting down their targets but also of inflicting tons of damage once contact is made.

As such, the Corax does not pepper its opponents with pellets from a gun, nor does it toast them with continuous beams of light.

Bastion Module I,33401,33400,"An electronic interface designed to augment and enhance a marauder's siege abilities.

This results in a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance and a boost to the ship's overall damage resistances. It also extends the reach of all the vessel's weapon systems, allowing it to engage targets at farther ranges. Due to the ionic field created by the bastion module, most remote effects - from friend or foe both - will not affect the ship while in bastion mode.  All weapons, including energy vampires and destabilizers, are unaffected by this field leaving the ship capacitor as one of the only vulnerable points to be found.

The Sanctuary corporation poured uncountable resources into making the cloaking technology developed for the Stratios fit the Nestor but were eventually forced to concede that it was impossible.  The effort was not without benefit though, as part of their work focused on reducing the Nestor's mass enough that it could make its way into unexplored territories that might've been hazardous to bulkier vessels. This paid off by affording the Nestor unmatched access to wormhole space, and meant that the embedded miniature rescue vessel on the ship's hull could be relegated to a decommissioned role.

Leopard,33514,33513,"Rumor has it the Leopard originated as a secret project in the Minmatar Republic. In their endless battle against enslavement by the Amarr Empire, the Minmatar have had to develop ways not only to liberate large masses of their people, but also to sneak in and capture individuals of high strategic importance. 

These kinds of black ops search-and-rescue missions might be executed for key people who were held by the enemy and possessed either special qualities the resistance needed, or information the Republic couldn't afford having tortured out of them. It's notable that these individuals might not all have been Minmatar, and that the resistance movement is unlikely to have restrained itself from using the same methods on key Amarr people they'd captured with the help of the Leopard.

It is an extremely fast ship, meant for quick and stealthy getaways, and while its origins are covered in rumors, chances are the Minmatar leaked it to the capsuleers in order to curry favor with them.",120000,120000,120000,90000

Stratios Emergency Responder,33554,33553,"<font size=""14""><b>Development</b></font>
The Stratios Emergency Responder is a variation on the Stratios designed by the Sanctuary specifically for fast assessment and evaluation of major cosmic events in New Eden.  Its official role to quickly appraise incidents of all kinds and relay information back to the Sisters of EVE also serves as an opportunity to take care of any sensitivities before they become apparent to external parties.

It is particularly adept at venturing into dangerous territories, not merely in recovering whatever may be of interest but also in being able to safely bring it back. Its engines have alternate power sources that come into play should any of its cargo - for which it has plenty of room - cause serious interference with internal systems. Its weaponry runs best on renewable sources, an ideal for a ship that doesn't know how long it'll be in deep space. Its carapace is extremely well armored for a ship this agile, and covered in sensors capable of letting its crew track a myriad of different organic signatures. The crew itself is safely protected from any number of transmittable ailments from rescues and other unexpected passengers, thanks to special quarantine bays that are conveniently located near jettisonable openings. 

And lastly, an ingenious but cryptic transfer in part of the warp core functionality to an outlying cylindrical structure means the Stratios Emergency Responder is able to run certain higher-level cloaking functions with very little technical cost, and minimal interference from warp. The Sisters of EVE have refused to comment on this technology, other than to recommend it not be tampered with.",240000,240000,240000,2400000
